### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
### I am Tushar Thapliyal
I have been enjoying development on cloud ever since I learnt the power of Terraform and build my first project "Deploying REST API on AWS". I am currently on the look out for a DevOps role, ideally working on architecting cloud infrastructures and building CI/CD pipelines. I'd specially love to work in at a startup in a tight  knit team where I can make an impact.
